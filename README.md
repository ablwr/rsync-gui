# rsync-gui

For people who want the power of rsync but are not familiar with the command
line or need a user-friendly way to understand the potential uses.

## TODO: 
- README
- come up with a cute name
- add server/remote functionality
- improve design
- add more options
- think about giving options vs clutter
- clean up html/selectors to better semantic practice
- add tooltips (maybe not necessary?)
